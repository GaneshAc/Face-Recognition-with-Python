# Face-Recognition-with-Python
Here we will deal with Face detection with python. OpenCVcontains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc  
Need to load the required XML classifiers. Then load our input image (or video) in grayscale mode. 
-Additional features will update soon. 

Note: saving images and then loading them isnâ€™t very efficient but works in this case and is extremely easy to implement.
